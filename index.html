	  <p>It seems like everything nowadays is a smart device. <bar> Smart toasters. <bar> Smart dog collars. <bar> Smart homes. <bar> In the age of smart, there is nothing more intelligent or more innovative than the devices being produced by the wearables industry. <bar>
Wearable devices help collect and analyze real-time personal data that informs us on everything from our health to our workouts. <bar> They’ve become extremely popular tools to help us stay informed and in touch with ourselves to the point that almost a quarter of people in the U.S. now sport a wearable device. <p/>
